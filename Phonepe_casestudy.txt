PhonePe Digital Payments Case Study:
(Analyzing Transaction and Demographic Data)

Overview:
This case study involves analyzing transaction data from the financial application PhonePe along with demographic data across various states and districts in India. The objective is to provide insights into transaction trends, device usage, and demographic correlations, while ensuring data consistency and performing advanced analyses to uncover deeper insights.

The datasets span multiple years and quarters, providing a comprehensive view of transactions, user behavior, and demographic details. Participants are expected to use their Python skills to load, explore, and analyze the data, ultimately deriving meaningful insights and visualizations.

Dataset Details:
The data is spread across multiple sheets in an Excel file, each containing different aspects of the transaction and demographic data. Below is an overview of each dataset:

This case study utilizes five key datasets:
State_Txn and Users:
Contains transaction and user data at the state level:

Number of transactions

Total transaction amount

Average transaction value

Number of registered users

App opens

State_TxnSplit:
Breakdown of transaction types at the state level:

Transaction types

Number of transactions

Total transaction amount

Average transaction value per type

State_DeviceData:
Details device brands used by registered users at the state level:

Number of registered users per brand

Percentage of users using each brand

District_Txn and Users:
Contains transaction and user data at the district level.

District Demographics:
Demographic details per district:

Population

Area

Population density

District headquarters
